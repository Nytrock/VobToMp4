# Vob to mp4
Have you ever faced the problem of converting videos from old DVDs to a more modern format? Free websites on the Internet not only
that work very slowly, they also have limitations in the form of file size. I donâ€™t want to pay for such a service at all, so I created this application!
It allows you to convert VOB video to mp4 in a very simple way and it works quite fast. All that is required of you is to place the processed
video to a special folder and run the program.

# Startup instructions
- Clone the repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Nytrock/Vob_To_Mp4.git
```

- Install dependencies with requirements.txt
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Put all the videos you want to convert into `videos` folder

- Run the program `main.py` and follow the instructions given in the program, at the same time, 
do not be afraid of the appearance of a large amount of text when converting video

- After the program ends, all converted videos will be in the `results` folder, while nothing will happen to the original videos
